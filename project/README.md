For my project, I have created a toy that in the initial state will toggle to blink and
beep upon the first button being pressed.
The second button had initially changed the color of the blinking light
(however, the assembly language had not worked out as a void method to
change the laser_color value).
The third and fourth buttons will decrease and increase the frequency of blinks and
beeps accordingly.

Should you push the button on the bottom board it will transfer into the musical mode.
This mode has two functional buttons:
The first button will play a small section of Take On Me by A-Ha
The second button will play a small section of Duel of Fates by John Williams
These snippets of songs will also have leds that blink with them:
Green if the note is the same as before
Red if the note is different from before
